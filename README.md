# Non-MarkovianAgent
In this project I simulate a daily trading scenario where a learning-based investor makes decisions based on the Sato-Crutchfield learning algorithm following non-Markovian rules.

Data files included in this repository contain synthetic stock price data generated for demonstration purposes. Real historical data used in the project cannot be redistributed due to licensing restrictions.
